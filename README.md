# Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Project scope
- Implement the push and pall opcodes: The opcode push pushes an element to the stack and the opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.
- Implement the pint opcode: The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
- Implement the pop opcode: The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.
- Implement the swap opcode: The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.
- Implement the add opcode: The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.
- Implement the nop opcode: The opcode nop doesnâ€™t do anything.
- Implement the sub opcode: The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second.
- Implement the div opcode: The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element.
- Implement the mul opcode: The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element.
- Implement the mod opcode: The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element by the top element. 
- Implement the # as a comment
- Implement the pchar opcode: The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

## General Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90
- All  files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the C standard library
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Compilation
This project  was compiled this way:

```
$ gcc -g -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90 *.c -o monty
```
